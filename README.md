# Gamified Learning and Exam AI Module (GLEAM)

🎓 **GLEAM** is an intelligent, adaptive, and modular Python backend engine designed to dynamically generates personalized gamified quizzes, grade responses, and provide a rich learning experience. Perfect for integration into educational web or mobile applications, GLEAM leverages open-source AI to help users learn better and smarter.

## 🌟 Project Overview

GLEAM isn’t just another quiz generator — it embodies IMAT:

- **Intelligence:** Generates and grades quizzes automatically from raw subject data using AI language models.
- **Modularity:** Easy-to-plug-in Python components fit any stack or framework.
- **Adaptability:** Modifies difficulty levels according to user performance and learning progression.
- **Transparency & Openness:** Built entirely with open-source tools, no proprietary locks or costs.

This makes GLEAM a powerful backend for gamified learning platforms, exam prep apps, and educational tools.

## 🔍 Module Descriptions

### 1. Quiz Generator

Generates multiple-choice questions on any topic and difficulty using an AI language model.

from transformers import pipeline

class QuizGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")

    def generate_question(self, topic, difficulty="medium"):
        prompt = f"Generate a {difficulty} level multiple-choice question on {topic} with answer and explanation:"
        result = self.generator(prompt, max_length=150, num_return_sequences=1)[0]['generated_text']
        return result

2. Syllabus Parser
Extracts text content from PDFs of syllabi and past exam papers.

import PyPDF2

class SyllabusParser:
    def extract_text(self, pdf_path):
        with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as f:
            reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(f)
            return " ".join([page.extract_text() for page in reader.pages])

3. Difficulty Manager
Adjusts question difficulty based on user’s current score.

class DifficultyManager:
    def get_next_level(self, current_score):
        if current_score < 3:
            return "easy"
        elif current_score < 7:
            return "medium"
        else:
            return "hard"

4. Feedback Engine
Delivers contextual explanations after answers are submitted.

class FeedbackEngine:
    def explain_answer(self, question, user_choice, correct_choice):
        if user_choice == correct_choice:
            return "Correct! You understood the concept well."
        else:
            return f"Incorrect. The correct answer was {correct_choice} because..."

5. Storage Handler
Persists user progress and scores locally in a SQLite database.

import sqlite3

class StorageHandler:
    def __init__(self, db_path="gleam.db"):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
        self.init_tables()

    def init_tables(self):
        c = self.conn.cursor()
        c.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sessions (user_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, score INTEGER, streak INTEGER)")
        self.conn.commit()

    def save_score(self, user_id, score, streak=0):
        c = self.conn.cursor()
        c.execute("""
            INSERT INTO sessions (user_id, score, streak) 
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
            ON CONFLICT(user_id) DO UPDATE SET
            score=excluded.score,
            streak=excluded.streak
        """, (user_id, score, streak))
        self.conn.commit()

    def get_score(self, user_id):
        c = self.conn.cursor()
        c.execute("SELECT score, streak FROM sessions WHERE user_id=?", (user_id,))
        return c.fetchone()

🛠️ Quick API Integration Example
Use GLEAM modules inside a Flask backend to serve quizzes dynamically:

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from gleam import QuizGenerator, DifficultyManager, StorageHandler

app = Flask(__name__)
qg = QuizGenerator()
dm = DifficultyManager()
sh = StorageHandler()

@app.route("/api/generateQuiz")
def generate_quiz():
    user_id = request.args.get("user_id", "anon")
    topic = request.args.get("topic", "logic")

    stats = sh.get_score(user_id)
    score = stats[0] if stats else 0
    difficulty = dm.get_next_level(score)
    quiz = qg.generate_question(topic, difficulty)

    return jsonify({
        "question": quiz,
        "difficulty": difficulty
    })

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=5000)


🌱 Roadmap and Next Steps
🧹 Refactor modules for stricter single responsibility and cleaner codebase.
⚡ Benchmark and optimize AI model usage and memory footprint.
📚 Expand question parsing, answer randomization, and feedback intelligence.
📦 Prepare for PyPI publishing with full packaging and versioning.
🔗 Introduce more integrations — React Native, FastAPI, or serverless deployment examples.
